        <h3> Why Willy Wonka's My Fav Movie</h3>
        <p>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, the old version with Gene Wilder is my favourite movie for many reasons. However, it is attached to a memory which I'm very fond of. I remember watching it with my Nanny when we lived in the old trailer park in Falmouth when I was a kid. I remember the flowing chocolate entry scene like it was yesterday, and how mesmerized I had been as a child. Even still, I continue to love the movie; here is a few more reasons..</p>
        <ul>
        <li>It is a feel good movie</li></ul>
        <ul><li>The whole movie is about chocolate and candy, how exciting</li></ul>
        <ul><li> Karma gets the little devil children and we love to see that</li></ul>
        <ul><li>The close relationship Charlie has with Grandpa Joe makes me warm and fuzzy remembering my Nanny</li></ul>
