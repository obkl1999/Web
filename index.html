        <h3> About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello. I'm Kaitlin, sometimes people call me Kait or Katie. I'm into horror movies, rock music, and my cat <em>Pickles.</em> I don't like pickles, but I love my cat. She was originally named Petals, but she was kind of hateful and sour so it switched to Pickles. It stuck, and now she doesn't remember her first name. I'm 25, and I previously took Social Services at Kingstec in Kentville. I worked as a <u>disability support worker</u> for six years, and decided I wanted to follow my <strong> passion </strong>of creating and art instead, so here I am!</p>
